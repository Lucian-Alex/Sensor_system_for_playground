# Sensor_system_playground
<br>

# Second semester project: I worked in a team of 4 on a multi-type sensor system demanded by Kompan A/S, world leader in playground manufacturing. The system is intended to pick up data about the users' activity on the playground, about users' themselves (weight, height) and about local weather. All data is intended to be used later in training sets for machine learning algorithms in order to detect patterns of use.

# The Arduino-based prototype is comprised of a network of 6 sensor units and 7 radio transceivers (nRF24L01+) whose data is stored and plotted in a VBA-customized Excel file.
